# Testing After Changes

- After making any code changes, you MUST validate those changes by running the corresponding tests:
  - After modifying a model, run the model tests:
    ```bash
    deno task test test/models/[ModifiedModelName].ts
    ```
  - After modifying a resource, run the resource tests:
    ```bash
    yarn mocha test/resources/[path/to/ResourceFile].ts
    ```
  - After modifying a query builder, ensure all model tests that use this query builder pass.
- Never consider a change complete until the relevant tests are passing.
- If tests fail after your changes, fix the issues before proceeding. Check [05_terminalCommands.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/shared/fundamentals/05_terminalCommands.mdc) for instructions.
