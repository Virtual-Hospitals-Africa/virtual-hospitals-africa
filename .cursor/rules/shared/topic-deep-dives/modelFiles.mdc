# Models File Documentation

Use kysely & kysely-postgres. Any new functions that interact with the database must accept (trx: TrxOrDb) as the first argument, representing the database or a transaction.

The models/_base.ts wraps a baseQuery enabling a rendered object to be returned as a result of finding by id or search.
